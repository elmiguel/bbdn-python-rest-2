Usage:
    bbrestapi get -o <learn_object> [-i <id>...] [-t <type>...] [-v] [-D] [-P <params>] [--get-page <page>]
    bbrestapi create -o <learn_object> -d <data> [-v] [-D]
    bbrestapi update -o <learn_object> -i <id>... -d <data> [-t <type>...] [-v] [-D]
    bbrestapi delete -o <learn_object> -i <id>... [-t <type>...] [-v] [-D]

Commands:
    get            Retrieve a given object or objects. Sends a GET request to API endpoint.
    create         Create an object. Sends a POST request to API endpoint.
    update         Updates an object or objects. Sends a PATCH request to API endpoint.
    delete         Deletes an object. Sends a DELETE request to API endpoint.

Inputs:
    learn_objects  The model class in which the data is used in transit. Singular form. Case Sensitive (lower case).
                       user: Will create a Learning Object as a User.
                       course: Will create a Learning Object as a Course.
                       term: Will create a Learning Object as a Term.
                       membership: Will create a Learning Object as a Membership.
                       datasource: Will create a Learning Object as a DataSource.
                       content: Will create a Learning Object as a Content item.
                       system: Will create a Learning Object as a System.
                       grade:  Will create a Learning Object as a Gradebook item. *(NOT IMPLEMENTED...yet)*


    id             If no id (<id>) specified, then will default to system get_all (200 pagination limit).
                   Required with --type options when not left to default. Always required with update, delete commands.
                   **Note: if more that one id is specified, then it is assumed that the first id is for the base rest
                            endpoint. The second is for the sub-item.

                        Example: /learn/api/public/v1/courses/{courseId}/contents/{contentId}

                        The {courseId} in this example will be replaced by the first id based on the settings in the
                        main settings.py file.

    data           Data to be sent to the REST API. JSON string data. Required for: create, update, and delete commands.
    types          Methods in which the API will use in the type of request.
                       primaryId: Default (nothing provided): Uses the pk1 id (_<id>_1)
                       externalId: Uses the batch_uid (external_person_key)
                       userName: Uses the user_id (the username instead of an id)

                   **Note: if more that one type is specified, then it is assumed that the first type is for the base
                           rest endpoint. The second is for the sub-item.

                        Example: /learn/api/public/v1/courses/{courseId}/contents/{contentId}

                        The {courseId} in this example will be replaced by the first type based on the settings in
                        the main settings.py file. The second type will be applied on the {contentId}. If only one
                        type is supplied, then the same type will be applied to both ids.

    params         Accepts a JSON String of key: value pairs that will be added to the RET API request.

                       offset: The number of rows to skip before beginning to return rows. An offset of 0 is the same as
                               omitting the offset parameter.

                       limit: The maximum number of results to be returned. There may be less if the query returned less
                              than the maximum.

                       fields: A comma-delimited list of fields to include in the response. If not specified, all fields
                               will be returned.

                   **Note: The params are built into the settings for defaults, if provided, then
                           the defaults will be overwritten.

Options:
    -h, --help                                       Show this screen.
    -v, --verbose                                    Verbose mode.
    -o <learn_object>, --learn-object <learn_object> Refer to Inputs: learn_objects.
    -i <id>..., --id <id>...                         Refer to Inputs: id.

    --get-page <page>                                Accepts the pagination value returned from a previous request.
                                                     If set, then all ids, types, params are ignored. As they are
                                                     already included in the paginated value.
