### Setting Up Your Development Environment
#### Python development tools

### What it does
The rest demo script demonstrates authenticating a REST application, management and use of the authorization token, and creating, updating, discovering, and deleting supported Learn objects.

<i><b>NOTE:</b> Before running the example code you must register a developer account and application as described on the Developer Community <a href="https://community.blackboard.com/docs/DOC-1579">What is the Developer Portal: Developer Registration and Application Management</a> and <a href="https://community.blackboard.com/docs/DOC-1580">Managing REST Integrations in Learn: The REST Integrations Tool for System Administrators</a> pages. You must also configure the script as outlined in the below Configure the Script section.</i>


## TODOS:
- [ ] Implement MongoDB Connector for storage
- [ ] Implement Stroage first approach and sync options
- [ ] Create a task to run through all test data

---
### Automation coming soon:
Create, Read, and Update a Data Source<br/>
Create, Read, and Update a Term<br/>
Create, Read, and Update a Course<br/>
Create, Read, and Update a User<br/>
Create, Read, and Update a Membership<br/>
Delete created objects in reverse order of create - membership, user, course, term, datasource.

When run with a specific command on an object only that operation will be run - you are responsible for system cleanup.

All generated output is sent to the terminal (or IDE output window).

## Running the Demo!
### Setup Your Test Server
To run the demo if you have not already done so you must as outlined above register the application via the Developer Portal and add the application to your test environment using the REST API Integration tool.


### Configuring the Script
Before executing the script to run against your test server you must configure it with your registered application's Key and Secret in the settings.py file.

Once you have setup your test server and edited the settings.py to reflect your application's key and secret you may run the command line tools as outlined above or via your IDE.
